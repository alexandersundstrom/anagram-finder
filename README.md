# Anagram Finder

## Instructions

The attached file is a word list with one word per line. 
* The task is to create a program that finds all words in the list that have one or more anagrams elsewhere in the list. 
* These must then be listed together with the original word. Not all words have an anagram, and you should only find one-word anagrams.

An anagram is a word or phrase put together by shuffling
the letters of another word or expression (http://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)


## Output
Each line in the result must contain the words that are anagrams of
each other. For example like this

akte teak kate


aldri arild


aller ralle


alt tal


andre rande denar ander
